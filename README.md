COOP is a member-owned cooperative ridesharing platform.

Did you know Uber and Lyft can take up to 45% of the fare for themselves? The drivers do, and they're sick of it.

What if a new app came along that slashed those fares by 20%, and only kept about 5% of the fare? Where the drivers and passengers owned the company?

Watch this space.
